\section{Mitre Att\&ck}\label{sec:mitre}
Mitre tracks activities of 100+ threat actors (groups).
They collect from real attacks and make structured observations.
They also give technical details, guidance and examples.

\subsection{Purposes}
\paragraph{Defenders}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Known Bad
  \item Coverage of Monitoring
  \item Effectiveness of Monitoring
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Attackers}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ideas for Alternatives
  \item Avoid getting trapped
  \item Simulation (Red Teaming)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Application}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Change over time
  \item Common language
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Navigator}
You can use the navigator with the primary filters for basic navigation and observation of ATT\&CK matrices. The heat map highlights the spectrum of the detection coverage including the blind spots where your organization does not have any coverage. With the heat map and navigator, you can quickly and efficiently identify your organization's detection capabilities and highlight gaps in the technique detection coverage. Hunt for threats and perform correlation of threats using associated features.
